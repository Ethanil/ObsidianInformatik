## Overview
### Grading
- Draft Submission 5%
- Peer Review 10% (2 pages)
- Doodles 5% (5-10 things)
- Code+Paper 50% (6 or 8 pages)
- Presentation 30% (10 or 15 minutes)
### Starting Tips
Before starting: Read this document once from top to bottom.
Everything takes time: Don't start on the last weekend before draft submission – you probably need more than one day! 3CP corresponds to roughly 4 h / week. For example, divide the work for the draft paper into smaller steps:
1) Download code, try to run it, play with it by writing original, custom examples, gather other material (papers, blogs, etc), summarize and doodle about it
2) Compare notes, brainstorm an initial code example to start the paper with, plan a paper structure, assign parts to persons, write draft paper, write code, write more notes and doodles
3) Have everyone in your group take look at the parts of the paper they didn’t write, give feedback, improve
4) Submit Draft Paper Before submitting: Read this document once from top to bottom again to check whether you missed something.

### Draft and Final Submission
For the draft and the final submission, upload a file a zip file called GROUPNAME.zip containing
- A file “main.pdf” for the paper
- A folder “code/” for the code and a file “code/README.md”
- A folder ”doodles/” for the doodles
Where the GROUPNAME is a short (one-word?) description of your topic that you think nobody else would pick, for example “spreadsheets” or “ECRO”...
Anonymous Draft Submissions: We want to distribute the submitted pdf files to the other students in the course for peer review, therefore your draft paper, code and doodles should contain no information that obviously identifies you (so hide the names and e-mail addresses of the group members)!
Final Submission Authorship: This time include and show author names; leave the address, institute and email-addresses empty.
Typical reviews at conferences in our field are “lightweight double-blind.” Double-blind means that both the author's and reviewer's identities are kept secret to avoid any bias. Lightweight means that direct references to the author names are omitted, while indirect ways to identify the author (for example by knowing that there is only a small set of authors that work on a given topic) are ignored.
For this seminar, we want the authors and reviewers to stay anonymous, so please do not write your name on your reviews.

### Peer Review Submission
You will receive a submission called FILENAME.zip from another group. Submit two files:
- FILENAME_annot.pdf: The PDF of the paper that you reviewed, with your annotations and comments
- FILENAME_review.pdf: A textual review
For this seminar, we want the reviewers to stay anonymous, so please do not write your name on your reviews.


### Paper
#### Formal Requirements
- LaTeX Template: Use the ACM article latex template
(https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/) with “\documentclass \[sigplan, review, authorversion, nonacm]{acmart}”
- Title: Come up with a custom title that fits your paper. Do not copy the title of an existing paper.
- No table of contents, no index. Hide CCS tags, hide keywords, no ACM copyright block.
- Bibliography: Use proper latex citations to manage your references. We do expect you to find and reference additional papers (2-3 per person) other than the papers we initially selected.
- (Reminder: draft anonymous, final submission with author names)
#### Structure and Length
In total, 6 pages for groups of two persons, and 8 pages for groups of three persons, with pages counted excluding bibliography:
- Abstract (¼ p)
- Motivation (1 p)
- …
- … (use topic appropriate titles)
- …
- Literature Critique (1p)
- Project Proposal and Conclusion (½-1p)
- References/Bibliography (not counted in total pages)
- Appendix: Declaration of Used Tools (¼ p) (not counted in total pages)
More details see below.

### Draft
The draft paper should already be as close to a full paper as possible. For the draft grading, we will primarily consider if you have seriously attempted to submit a draft that fulfills the formal requirements, paper structure and section length guidelines (section length  doesn't need to fit 100% but should be roughly maintained) and whether you considered the pre-submission checklist.

### Doodle
Materials showing your working process:
In particular: Annotated Screenshots (annotated similar to how peer review annotations work, as described below) of things that helped you understand the topic, for example that contained an important explanation, formulae or diagram that helped you understand:
- A (part of a) page of a paper or similar
- A (part of a) page of a book or similar
- A (part of a) page of a research talk video / slides or similar
- A (part of a) page of a blog or similar
- A (part of a) page of a wikipedia or similar
- (A part of an AI Chat that you had
Further: A text file, a mind map, sketches, or any form of notes you took and helped you understand the topic and plan the paper or presentation.
We don’t have to completely understand your doodles, your thinking process belongs to you; but they should demonstrate that you have worked on and thought about your seminar topic.

> Objectives Exergames can replace sedentary time spent on computer gaming with physical activity. Previous research has found exergaming to elicit light-to-moderate exercise intensity. Our primary aim was to examine the exercise intensity of a newly developed biking exergame. Methods Eight males (23.9±0.6 years) played the exergame (PLAY) and walked (WALK) on three separate occasions, with the condition counterbalanced and in random sequence within each day. They were asked to PLAY and WALK for a minimum of 15 min and then continue for as long as they wanted. We measured heart rate (HR), activity duration, caloric expenditure and subject-rated exertion and enjoyment (based on 0–10 Visual Analogue Scale, VAS). We used an average of each outcome variable across the 3 days in the analysis. Results The average intensity during PLAY (73%±10% of HRmax) was significantly higher than that during WALK (57%±7% of HRmax, p=0.01). Participants spent 12.5±5.3 min at 80%–89% of HRmax and 5.5±4.6 min at ≥90% of HRmax during PLAY, whereas intensity during WALK was ≤72% of HRmax. The duration of PLAY was 44.3±0.7 min and of WALK 17.0±0.7 min (p=0.01). The relative energy expenditure during PLAY was 7.6±0.7 kcal/min and during WALK 6.2±0.3 kcal/min (p<0.01). The enjoyment of PLAY (VAS 8.7±0.1) was higher than that of WALK (VAS 3.9±1.8, p=0.01). Conclusions Exergaming can be an innovative way of enjoyable high-intensity training.

> Participants reported to the laboratory at Dublin City University on 4 different days separated by at least 48 h ([Fig. 1](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118470#pone-0118470-g001)). On day 1, participants carried out an incremental maximal test on a cycle ergometer (Velotron; RacerMate, Seattle, WA) to determine peak oxygen uptake (V̇O2peak) and peak power output. On day 2, participants familiarised themselves with the GameBike and the video game during a 30-min session. On the final two visits participants played the ICVG or cycled for 30-mins in random order.

> Strategies to encourage exercise have led to research on cycle ergometer ‘exergaming’, as a means of enhancing exercise enjoyment. This research has typically prescribed the exercise intensity and used one exercise mode. The aim of this study was to compare self-selected exercise intensity on a cycle ergometer with and without exergaming modes activated. A total of 20 participants aged between 18–40 years (_M_ = 24.2 ± 5.9) completed a sub-maximal exercise test. Participants returned two days later to complete one 45 minute session of self-selected exercise with 15 minutes in each of ‘control’ (standard ergometer), ‘track’, and ‘game’ modes, with order randomized. Heart rate, work rate, perceived exertion, and affective valence were recorded during exercise. Dissociation and enjoyment were recorded in the rest interval between each mode. Participants exercised above ventilatory threshold (VT) in all three modes (track, _M_ = 9.5 _±_ 12%; game, _M_ = 6.2 _±_ 12%; and control, _M_ = 4.4 _±_ 14% above VT) and at higher work rates (_P_ < 0.05) exergaming (track, _M_ = 94.5 _±_ 27.9; game, M = 96.2 _±_ 32.8 watts) than control (M = 86.6 _±_ 26.5 watts). Despite exercising at a higher intensity, participants perceived exercise during the exergaming modes to be most pleasant (_P_ < 0.01), with greater enjoyment _(P <_ 0.01) and dissociation _(P <_ 0.01) in the game than track mode, and both modes higher on these variables than the control mode. Findings support the use of exergaming as a strategy to encourage individuals to exercise, with participants choosing to work harder physiologically, but reporting more positive psychological responses during and following the exercise.

> **_Materials and Methods:_** A two-phase approach (calibration and exercise phase) was applied in a sample of 16 physically active adults. In the cardio-exergame “LetterBird,” the flight of a pigeon was controlled by the pedaling rate of a bike ergometer as input device. During the calibration phase the individual heart rate (HR) responses of the players were measured. In the exercise phase, these data were used to adjust the resistance of the ergometer using the proposed algorithm. The purpose of this algorithm was to induce an individually defined target HR and to keep it in a steady state. In order to establish a reference for further studies, the game experience was measured using the kids-Game Experience Questionnaire.

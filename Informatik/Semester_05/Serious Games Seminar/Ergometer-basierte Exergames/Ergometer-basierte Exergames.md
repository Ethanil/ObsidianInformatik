> Objectives Exergames can replace sedentary time spent on computer gaming with physical activity. Previous research has found exergaming to elicit light-to-moderate exercise intensity. Our primary aim was to examine the exercise intensity of a newly developed biking exergame. Methods Eight males (23.9±0.6 years) played the exergame (PLAY) and walked (WALK) on three separate occasions, with the condition counterbalanced and in random sequence within each day. They were asked to PLAY and WALK for a minimum of 15 min and then continue for as long as they wanted. We measured heart rate (HR), activity duration, caloric expenditure and subject-rated exertion and enjoyment (based on 0–10 Visual Analogue Scale, VAS). We used an average of each outcome variable across the 3 days in the analysis. Results The average intensity during PLAY (73%±10% of HRmax) was significantly higher than that during WALK (57%±7% of HRmax, p=0.01). Participants spent 12.5±5.3 min at 80%–89% of HRmax and 5.5±4.6 min at ≥90% of HRmax during PLAY, whereas intensity during WALK was ≤72% of HRmax. The duration of PLAY was 44.3±0.7 min and of WALK 17.0±0.7 min (p=0.01). The relative energy expenditure during PLAY was 7.6±0.7 kcal/min and during WALK 6.2±0.3 kcal/min (p<0.01). The enjoyment of PLAY (VAS 8.7±0.1) was higher than that of WALK (VAS 3.9±1.8, p=0.01). Conclusions Exergaming can be an innovative way of enjoyable high-intensity training.

> Participants reported to the laboratory at Dublin City University on 4 different days separated by at least 48 h ([Fig. 1](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118470#pone-0118470-g001)). On day 1, participants carried out an incremental maximal test on a cycle ergometer (Velotron; RacerMate, Seattle, WA) to determine peak oxygen uptake (V̇O2peak) and peak power output. On day 2, participants familiarised themselves with the GameBike and the video game during a 30-min session. On the final two visits participants played the ICVG or cycled for 30-mins in random order.

> Strategies to encourage exercise have led to research on cycle ergometer ‘exergaming’, as a means of enhancing exercise enjoyment. This research has typically prescribed the exercise intensity and used one exercise mode. The aim of this study was to compare self-selected exercise intensity on a cycle ergometer with and without exergaming modes activated. A total of 20 participants aged between 18–40 years (_M_ = 24.2 ± 5.9) completed a sub-maximal exercise test. Participants returned two days later to complete one 45 minute session of self-selected exercise with 15 minutes in each of ‘control’ (standard ergometer), ‘track’, and ‘game’ modes, with order randomized. Heart rate, work rate, perceived exertion, and affective valence were recorded during exercise. Dissociation and enjoyment were recorded in the rest interval between each mode. Participants exercised above ventilatory threshold (VT) in all three modes (track, _M_ = 9.5 _±_ 12%; game, _M_ = 6.2 _±_ 12%; and control, _M_ = 4.4 _±_ 14% above VT) and at higher work rates (_P_ < 0.05) exergaming (track, _M_ = 94.5 _±_ 27.9; game, M = 96.2 _±_ 32.8 watts) than control (M = 86.6 _±_ 26.5 watts). Despite exercising at a higher intensity, participants perceived exercise during the exergaming modes to be most pleasant (_P_ < 0.01), with greater enjoyment _(P <_ 0.01) and dissociation _(P <_ 0.01) in the game than track mode, and both modes higher on these variables than the control mode. Findings support the use of exergaming as a strategy to encourage individuals to exercise, with participants choosing to work harder physiologically, but reporting more positive psychological responses during and following the exercise.

> **_Materials and Methods:_** A two-phase approach (calibration and exercise phase) was applied in a sample of 16 physically active adults. In the cardio-exergame “LetterBird,” the flight of a pigeon was controlled by the pedaling rate of a bike ergometer as input device. During the calibration phase the individual heart rate (HR) responses of the players were measured. In the exercise phase, these data were used to adjust the resistance of the ergometer using the proposed algorithm. The purpose of this algorithm was to induce an individually defined target HR and to keep it in a steady state. In order to establish a reference for further studies, the game experience was measured using the kids-Game Experience Questionnaire.

> Kraft, JA, Russell, WD, Bowman, TA, Selsor III, CW, and Foster, GD. Heart rate and perceived exertion during self-selected intensities for exergaming compared to traditional exercise in college-age participants. _J Strength Cond Res_ 25(6): 1736-1742, 2011—Exergames may be useful for promoting physical activity in younger populations. Heart rate (HRs) responses and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) at self-selected intensities were compared in college-age participants during 2 modes of exergame activity vs. traditional exercise. Thirty-seven participants (men: 20, women: 17) completed 3 30-minute self-selected intensity trials: (a) video game interactive bicycle ergometer (GB) (CatEye GB300), (b) interactive video dance game (Dance Dance Revolution [DDR]), and (c) traditional cycle ergometer (CE) while watching television. Mean HR, peak HR (PkHR), and minutes above target HR (THR) were significantly higher for GB (144 ± 22 b·min−1 [57% HR reserve (HRR)], 161 ± 23 b·min−1, and 22.5 ± 11.1 minutes) than for DDR (119 ± 16 b·min−1 [37% HRR], 138 ± 20 b·min−1, and 11.2 ± 11.9 minutes) or for CE (126 ± 20 b·min−1 [42% HRR], 144 ± 24 b·min−1, and 14.2 ± 12.6 minutes). The RPE was significantly higher for GB (4.2 ± 1.5) and CE (3.8 ± 1.2) than for DDR (2.7 ± 1.3). Recovery HR (RecHR) (15 minutes postexercise) was significantly higher for GB (91 ± 14 b·min−1) than for DDR (80 ± 11 b·min−1) and neared significance vs. CE (84 ± 14 b·min−1, _p_ = 0.059). No difference in PkHR, RecHR, or minutes above THR was observed between DDR and CE. Session RPE was significantly higher for GB (4.6 ± 1.7) and CE (4.1 ± 1.6) than for DDR (2.8 ± 1.5). All modes elicited extended proportions of time above THR; GB: 75%, DDR: 37%, and CE: 47%. Results support that exergames are capable of eliciting physiological responses necessary for fitness improvements. Practitioners might consider exergames as periodic activity options for clients needing motivation to be regularly active.

> **Introduction:** Regular physical exercise is believed to counteract the adverse physiological consequences of aging. However, smart fitness equipment specifically designed for older adults is quite rare. Here we designed an exergame-integrated internet of things (IoT)-based ergometer system (EIoT-ergo) that delivers personalized exercise prescriptions for older adults. First, physical fitness was evaluated using the Senior Fitness Test (SFT) application. Then, radio frequency identification (RFID) triggered the EIoT-ergo to deliver the corresponding exercise session based on the individual level of physical fitness. The exercise intensity during each workout was measured to generate the next exercise session. Further, EIoT-ergo provides an exergame to help users control and maintain their optimal cadence while engaging in exercise.

>**Methods:** Thirty-two low active older adults (73.9 ± 7.3 years, _n_ = 16, 8 females) with or without MCI (70.9 ± 5.5 years, _n_ = 16, 11 females) participated in a sub-maximal fitness assessment to determine ventilatory threshold (VT) and two experimental sessions (counterbalanced: exergaming or regular ergometer cycling). Experimental sessions consisted 21-min of continuous cycling with 7-min at each: RPE 9, 11 and 13. Oxygen consumption (VO2), heart rate (HR), and affect (Feeling Scale) were obtained throughout the exercise.
